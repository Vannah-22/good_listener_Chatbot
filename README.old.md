# E.M.A.: Emotion Management Assistant
This is my Computer Camp final project. I am creating an interactive chatbot designed to have user practice emotion management. 


My goal for this class project is to create a chatbot based on emotion management. The idea for this came from my own experience with metal and emotional health. The program will be an interactive emotion board, designed to provide important words for someone to use when they are distressed. The system homepage will have one question: “How are you feeling today?”. Knowing that I do not have a lot of experience coding chat bots, I am starting off with only three or four emotions for the user to choose from (Happy, Sad, Angry, Anxious). As I continue with the project outside of the bootcamp, I plan on adding more complex emotions, like Lonely and Bored. The user has about 3 options, each color coordinated buttons that display a common feelings. When the user selects an emotion button, the chatbot will give helpful responses and advice.
For example, if the user selects “Sad’’, the chatbot can respond with fun activities, like ‘read a book, play a board game, go for a walk, learn to cook a new recipe, watch an episode of your favorite show, write a story’ or words of affirmation like ‘it’s normal to feel sad and lonely from time to time,’ ‘you are not alone’, and ‘ your feelings are valid.’ 
If the user suggests “Happy”, the chatbot can respond with “I am happy that you’re happy!”, “be proud of your accomplishments”, “you are loved”, “Look at you go!”.
The goal of the program itself is to help normalize mental health by creating a simple outlet for people to communicate their feelings to others. I also plan on putting helpful links and contact information for the user, like contact numbers and ways to reach out for support if they are in distress. Talking to a person about how we feel can be daunting and anxiety inducing, and sometimes we don’t need a person to talk AT or TO us, but rather, someone that can listen to us. 

FUNCTIONALITY:
	Users will choose between a set number of emotions. Once they select a button, the program will respond with positive words of affirmation, helpful advice, or supportive responses.
	The program will be designed to give relatable and believable responses to avoid sounding robotic. In conversation, our interactions are natural because they are based on two (or more) parties that are reacting to each other on a certain topic; these reactions are very specific, and it can be hard to mimic entire conversations because there are a lot of topics that can be talked about. The chat bot will give realistic, vague responses based solely on the user’s choice. Phrases about certain circumstances will be avoided, because this is meant to appeal to a lot of different people with different backgrounds. Not only will it be relatable, it will be productive to support the user; comments are designed to validate the user’s feelings and make them feel heard rather than lectured. 


TIMELINE: 
  March 16th, 2021: develop and complete a list of common responses to all emotional options: each main emotion will have 3 initial responses, and 3 secondary responses. 
This includes positive affirmations, helpful advice, and words of encouragement. 
Include research links and contact information for more trusted sources. 
**Create response loops: “Why are you feeling this way?” “Tell me more” “I’m sorry you feel this way” “Your feelings are valid”

March 19th: complete a wireframe of the site. Create a decision tree for all options. 

March 23rd: complete a mockup for the site. Organize all files needed and draw out file-map for the project. 

March 24th: Finish Happy emotion

March 25th: Finish Sad emotion

March 26th: Finish Angry emotion

March 27th: Finish Anxious emotion (if all other emotions are successfully complete)

March 30th, 2021: detail work, style, design, unit testing, trial runs with users.
